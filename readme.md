## Deployment

### Gitpod to GitHub commits

To help with controlling versions you can commit to GitHub via Gitpod.
Once you are able to view the repository in Gitpod this is done by:

1. Access the control terminal
    - Usually found at bottom of project in "workspace" section.
2. Next to gitpod/workspace/(name of project)
    - Type "git add (and name of document you wish to commit to GitHub)".
    - If you want to find all that could be committed then you can type "git add ."
3. Type "git status"
    - This will help show what files have been modified, added or deleted for a pre-check prior to committing.
4. Type "git commit -m ("and then a brief description of latest updates in quotation marks")"
5. Type "git push"
6. Log into GitHub
    - Locate repository
    - You should be able to see the latest and history of commits in code section at top right of table of files list.
    ![git-commits](assets/readme-files/ TO BE UPDATED)



### Deploying via GitHub Pages

1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TO BE UPDATED] or create an account.
2. Click on settings and ensure repository name is selected to TO BE UPDATED.
3. Scroll down to GitHub Pages section and ensure Branch is 'Master' and folder is 'root'.
4. Click save and wait for site to be published.
5. Click link in GitHub Pages section to view published site.

### Forking repository

Forking a repository in GitHub is used to make a copy of a repository which you do not have rights access to. Once you have forked a repository you will be able to make changes without affecting the original. It can also be used to suggest changes of an original project and/or propose a project as starting point.

Steps on Forking a repository:
1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TO BE UPDATED] or create an account.
2. At the top right hand corner of the page select "Fork".
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository to work with on your account without affecting the original.

### Cloning a repository

Cloning a repository in GitHub allows you to make a copy of your own repository which will affect the original repository.
If you wish to make changes which do not affect the original then this should be forked.

Steps to Clone a repository
1. Log into GitHub and look for [https://github.com/TO BE UPDATED] or create an account.
2. Ensure "Code" has been selected in menu.
3. Select code on top right of table.
4. Select either HTTPS, SSH or CLI.
5. You can either download ZIP for static files and utilise in GitHub or open with GitHub desktop.
6. If opening with GitHub Desktop then select. If not downloaded this will need to be to utilise benefits.
7. Once opened with GitHub Desktop select "File".
8. Select "Clone repository".
